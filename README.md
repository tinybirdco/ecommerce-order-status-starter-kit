# eCommerce Order Status Starter Kit

Example application showcasing how to build out the backend of a demo eCommerce platform to show real-time analytics, which can be used to build a real-time dashboard. This example is built on top of Tinybird, Kafka, and Snowflake. This app allows you to track the status of orders in real-time, from placement to shipping and delivery, ultimately leading to better order management and improved customer satisfaction.

‚ö†Ô∏èWarning! The Admin token, the one you copied following this guide, is your admin token. Don't share it or publish it in your application. You can manage your tokens via API or using the Auth Tokens section in the UI. More detailed info at [Auth Tokens management](https://www.tinybird.co/docs/api-reference/token-api.html)
